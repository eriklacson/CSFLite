# CSF-Lite Framework

A practical, lightweight implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF v2.0) for small tech teams, startups, and SMEs. Combines automated scanning (via Nuclei) with manual governance checks to produce a fast, actionable security baseline.

---

## Vision

**CSF-Lite** is designed for lean security operations. Instead of overwhelming organizations with the full CSF catalog, this framework focuses on:

- The **Top 25 most impactful subcategories** across all CSF Functions
- What can be **automated via scan** (e.g., open ports, outdated software, misconfigurations)
- What must be **validated manually** (e.g., policies, incident response plans, recovery strategies)

---

## What’s Included

This repository contains:

- ✅ Curated CSF-Lite **subcategories** list (top 25)
- ✅ Mapping of **Nuclei templates → CSF subcategories**
- ✅ A Python scripts for mappping scan outputs to CSF subcategories.
- ✅ CSV/JSON **lookup tables** for automation
- ✅ A **manual questionnaire** for non-automatable items
- ✅ Suggested **remediation guidance**
- ✅ Example **report templates**

## Use Case

This toolkit is for:

- **SMEs/startups** that want structured risk insight without enterprise overhead
- **Freelancers/consultants** running lightweight assessments
- **Security-oriented DevOps teams** bridging scanning and policy gaps
