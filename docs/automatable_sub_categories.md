# CSF-Lite: Automatable CSF Subcategories

This document lists the subset of CSF-Lite subcategories from the Top 25 that can be either **fully** or **partially automated** using vulnerability scanning tools such as Nuclei. These should form the core of your automated scan logic.

Each entry includes the CSF ID, Function, automation coverage level, and a short description of how it can be addressed via scanning.

---

## ðŸŸ¦ Identify

### ID.AM-02 â€” Devices and systems inventoried *(Partial)*

> Nuclei and network scans detect open ports and exposed services, but donâ€™t inventory internal/cloud assets fully.

### ID.RA-05 â€” External information systems are cataloged *(Partial)*

> Detects exposed API endpoints, public tokens, and leaked credentials, but not vendor lists or formal tracking.

---

## ðŸŸ© Protect

### PR.AC-01 â€” Identities and credentials are managed *(Full)*

> Nuclei checks like `default-logins/*` detect default or weak credentials on exposed services.

### PR.AC-03 â€” Remote access is managed *(Full)*

> Templates such as `auth/open-admin` detect admin panels or management interfaces lacking authentication.

### PR.DS-01 â€” Data-at-rest is protected *(Full)*

> Missing HTTP headers like `X-Content-Type-Options` can be identified by header-based Nuclei templates.

### PR.DS-06 â€” Integrity checking mechanisms are used *(Full)*

> Directory listing, file exposure, or checksum failures are discoverable through Nuclei misconfiguration templates.

### PR.PT-04 â€” Communications and control networks are protected *(Full)*

> Weak SSL ciphers, self-signed certs, and Heartbleed can be detected via `ssl/*` templates.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ Detect

### DE.CM-01 â€” Unauthorized connections and devices are monitored *(Partial)*

> Anomalies like unexpected HTTP 5xx errors can hint at unauthorized behavior but deeper monitoring requires agents.

### DE.CM-07 â€” Unauthorized changes to systems are monitored *(Partial)*

> Can catch some file exposure/configuration drift, but lacks deep OS-level file integrity monitoring.

### DE.CM-08 â€” Vulnerability scans are performed *(Full)*

> Nuclei CVE and software template packs perform surface-level vuln scanning.

### DE.AE-01 â€” Network baselines are established and managed *(Partial)*

> Repeated scanning can reveal changes or anomalies over time, but true baselining requires behavioral analytics.

Use these subcategories to guide your scan pack selection, Nuclei template curation, and automation roadmap. Combine with manual checks to achieve full CSF-Lite coverage.
