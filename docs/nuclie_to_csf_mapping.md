# CSF-Lite: Nuclei-to-CSF Mapping (with Remediation)

This table maps key Nuclei templates to NIST CSF v2.0 subcategories used in the CSF-Lite framework. It includes rationale and practical remediation advice.

| TemplateID Prefix                  | Finding Name                          | CSF Function | Subcategory ID | Subcategory Name                                       | Rationale                                                                                             | Suggested Remediation                                               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `networking/open-ports`           | Open Ports Detected                   | Identify     | ID.AM-02        | Devices and systems inventoried                        | Open ports reflect active assets and exposed services—critical to inventory.                         | Close unnecessary ports or restrict access via firewall/security group. |
| `exposures/git-auth-token`        | Publicly Exposed Git Auth Token       | Identify     | ID.RA-05        | External information systems are cataloged            | Leaked tokens indicate poor control over external systems and APIs.                                  | Revoke the token, rotate credentials, and apply `.gitignore` rules.     |
| `default-logins/ssh-default-creds`| SSH Default Credentials               | Protect      | PR.AC-01        | Identities and credentials are managed                | Default or weak credentials are an easy entry point for attackers.                                   | Change default passwords and enforce key-based SSH authentication.     |
| `auth/open-admin`                 | Unauthenticated Admin Panel           | Protect      | PR.AC-03        | Remote access is managed                              | Exposed admin interfaces without auth represent a major control gap.                                 | Restrict access with authentication, IP allowlists, or VPN.             |
| `headers/missing-content-type`    | Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header | Protect      | PR.DS-01        | Data-at-rest is protected                             | Lack of this header allows MIME-sniffing attacks, risking improper content execution.                 | Add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to all server responses.         |
| `misconfiguration/dir-listing`    | Open Directory Listing                | Protect      | PR.DS-06        | Integrity checking mechanisms are used                | Directory listing exposes files and internal structure, violating data integrity and confidentiality. | Disable directory listing in your web server (e.g., Apache/NGINX).     |
| `ssl/self-signed`                 | Self-Signed SSL Certificate           | Protect      | PR.PT-04        | Communications and control networks are protected     | Self-signed certs break trust boundaries, allowing MITM attacks.                                     | Replace with a valid certificate from a trusted CA (e.g., Let’s Encrypt). |
| `ssl/weak-cipher`                 | Weak TLS Ciphers Supported            | Protect      | PR.PT-04        | Communications and control networks are protected     | Deprecated ciphers make encrypted communications vulnerable to compromise.                            | Disable weak ciphers and enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.                     |
| `ssl/heartbleed`                  | Heartbleed TLS Vulnerability          | Protect      | PR.PT-04        | Communications and control networks are protected     | Heartbleed allows memory disclosure over encrypted channels—critical to mitigate.                    | Upgrade to a patched OpenSSL version (≥1.0.1g) and reissue certs.      |
| `software/outdated-plugin`        | Outdated WordPress Plugin Detected    | Detect       | DE.CM-08        | Vulnerability scans are performed                     | Identifies outdated components with known CVEs—core to vuln management.                              | Update the plugin to the latest secure version or disable it.           |
| `cves/2021/CVE-2021-44228`        | Log4Shell RCE                         | Detect       | DE.CM-08        | Vulnerability scans are performed                     | High-impact CVE; confirms that vulnerability scanning is actually working.                           | Patch Log4j to version ≥2.17.0 or apply vendor-specific mitigations.   |
