# CSF-Lite: Top 25 NIST CSF v2.0 Subcategories

These are the 25 most impactful and practical subcategories from the NIST CSF v2.0, selected for inclusion in the CSF-Lite framework. They span all six CSF Functions and are prioritized for SME environments.
Each subcategory includes its ID, Function, and a plain-language rationale.

---

### Govern


### GV.P0-01 — Cybersecurity Policy is Established

> Policy and strategy for managing cybersecurity created, communicated and enforced.

### GV.SC-01 — Supply chain agreements are managed

> Vendor relationships should include security responsibilities and breach handling.

### GV.RR-01 — Roles and responsibilities are assigned

> Clear cybersecurity roles ensure accountability for managing risk.


---

## Identify

### ID.AM-02 — Assets and systems inventoried

> You can’t secure what you don’t know. This ensures visibility into physical and cloud-based assets.

### ID.AM-05 — Resources are prioritized based on classification, criticality, and business value.

> Prioritizing critical assets helps focus limited security resources for maximum impact.

### ID.RA-05 — External information systems are cataloged

> Third-party APIs and SaaS dependencies must be tracked as part of your risk surface.



---

## Protect

### PR.AA-01 — Identities and credentials are managed

> Default credentials are a common attack vector—manage them with intent.

### PR.AA-03 — Remote access is managed

> Unrestricted admin interfaces expose critical systems to external threat actors.

### PR.DS-01 — Data-at-rest is protected

> Controls like encryption and content-type headers prevent data leaks.

### PR.DS-10 — Integrity checking mechanisms are used

> File exposures or tampering can be detected through integrity monitoring.

### PR.IR-01 — Communications and control networks are protected

> Ensuring encrypted, trusted communications is critical to security posture.

---

## Detect

### DE.CM-01 — The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events

> Monitoring network traffic helps detect intrusions, anomalies, and other cybersecurity events early

### DE.CM-07 — Monitoring for unauthorized changes to systems is performed

> File or configuration drift detection is a key indicator of compromise.

### DE.CM-08 — Vulnerability scans are performed

> Routine scanning detects outdated components and known issues.

### DE.AE-01 — A baseline of network operations and expected data flows for users and systems is established and managed

> Establishing baselines for network operations and expected data flows helps detect anomalies

---

## Respond

### RS.RP-01 — Response plan is executed

> Testing your IR plan ensures you're ready when incidents occur.

### RS.CO-02 — Public relations are managed

> Clear external communication reduces panic and damage during incidents.

### RS.CO-03 — Legal and regulatory requirements are managed

> Responding to incidents must follow laws, contracts, and disclosure rules.

### RS.MI-01 — Incidents are mitigated

> Effective mitigation limits the impact of breaches.

### RS.IM-01 — Response plans are improved following lessons learned

> Every incident should help improve future response capability.

---

## Recover

### RC.RP-01 — Recovery plan is executed

> Restoration procedures must be tested and reliable.

### RC.IM-01 — Recovery strategies are improved following exercises

> Practice reveals gaps and improves speed of recovery.

### RC.IM-02 — Recovery plans incorporate lessons learned

> Continuously refining recovery plans strengthens resilience.

### RC.CO-01 — Communications are coordinated during recovery

> Internal clarity and external updates are critical during restoration.

### RC.GV-01 — Recovery policies and procedures are established

> Documentation ensures everyone knows their role post-incident.
