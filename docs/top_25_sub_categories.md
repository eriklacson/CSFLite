# CSF-Lite: Top 25 NIST CSF v2.0 Subcategories

These are the 25 most impactful and practical subcategories from the NIST CSF v2.0, selected for inclusion in the CSF-Lite framework. They span all five CSF Functions and are prioritized for SME environments.

Each subcategory includes its ID, Function, and a plain-language rationale.

## ðŸŸ¦ Identify

### ID.AM-02 â€” Devices and systems inventoried

> You canâ€™t secure what you donâ€™t know. This ensures visibility into physical and cloud-based assets.

### ID.AM-05 â€” Resources are prioritized and protected

> Prioritizing critical assets helps focus limited security resources for maximum impact.

### ID.RA-05 â€” External information systems are cataloged

> Third-party APIs and SaaS dependencies must be tracked as part of your risk surface.

### ID.SC-01 â€” Supply chain agreements are managed

> Vendor relationships should include security responsibilities and breach handling.

### ID.GV-01 â€” Governance roles, policies, and processes are established

> Assigning roles and documenting processes sets the foundation for any security program.

## ðŸŸ© Protect

### PR.AC-01 â€” Identities and credentials are managed

> Default credentials are a common attack vectorâ€”manage them with intent.

### PR.AC-03 â€” Remote access is managed

> Unrestricted admin interfaces expose critical systems to external threat actors.

### PR.DS-01 â€” Data-at-rest is protected

> Controls like encryption and content-type headers prevent data leaks.

### PR.DS-06 â€” Integrity checking mechanisms are used

> File exposures or tampering can be detected through integrity monitoring.

### PR.PT-04 â€” Communications and control networks are protected

> Ensuring encrypted, trusted communications is critical to security posture.

## ðŸŸ¨ Detect

### DE.CM-01 â€” Unauthorized connections and devices are monitored

> Network monitoring helps spot intrusions and abnormal activity early.

### DE.CM-02 â€” Physical environment is monitored for security events

> Physical access risks should be logged and reviewedâ€”even in digital-first companies.

### DE.CM-07 â€” Unauthorized changes to systems are monitored

> File or configuration drift detection is a key indicator of compromise.

### DE.CM-08 â€” Vulnerability scans are performed

> Routine scanning detects outdated components and known issues.

### DE.AE-01 â€” A baseline of network operations is established and managed

> Knowing what "normal" looks like enables detection of anomalies.

## ðŸŸ¥ Respond

### RS.RP-01 â€” Response plan is executed

> Testing your IR plan ensures you're ready when incidents occur.

### RS.CO-02 â€” Public relations are managed

> Clear external communication reduces panic and damage during incidents.

### RS.CO-03 â€” Legal and regulatory requirements are managed

> Responding to incidents must follow laws, contracts, and disclosure rules.

### RS.MI-01 â€” Incidents are mitigated

> Effective mitigation limits the impact of breaches.

### RS.IM-01 â€” Response plans are improved following lessons learned

> Every incident should help improve future response capability.

---

## ðŸŸª Recover

### RC.RP-01 â€” Recovery plan is executed

> Restoration procedures must be tested and reliable.

### RC.IM-01 â€” Recovery strategies are improved following exercises

> Practice reveals gaps and improves speed of recovery.

### RC.IM-02 â€” Recovery plans incorporate lessons learned

> Continuously refining recovery plans strengthens resilience.

### RC.CO-01 â€” Communications are coordinated during recovery

> Internal clarity and external updates are critical during restoration.

### RC.GV-01 â€” Recovery policies and procedures are established

> Documentation ensures everyone knows their role post-incident.
