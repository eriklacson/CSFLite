# CSF-Lite: Top 25 NIST CSF v2.0 Subcategories

These are the 25 most impactful and practical subcategories from the NIST CSF v2.0, selected for inclusion in the CSFLite framework. They span all six CSF Functions and are prioritized for SME environments.
Each subcategory includes its ID, Function, and a plain-language rationale.

---

### Govern


### GV.P0-01 — Cybersecurity Policy is Established

> Policy and strategy for managing cybersecurity created, communicated and enforced.

### GV.SC-01 — Supply chain agreements are managed

> Vendor relationships should include security responsibilities and breach handling.

### GV.RR-01 — Roles and responsibilities are assigned

> Clear cybersecurity roles ensure accountability for managing risk.

### GV.RM-01 — Risk management activities are reviewed and adjusted. 

> Risk management practices improves through regular review and adjustment.

## Identify

### ID.AM-02 — Assets and systems inventoried

> You can’t secure what you don’t know. This ensures visibility into physical and cloud-based assets.

### ID.AM-03 — Baseline of operations/data flows established & managed

> Normal system and data flow patterns are defined and maintained to spot unusual activity.

### ID.AM-04 — External information systems are cataloged

> Third-party APIs and SaaS dependencies must be tracked as part of your risk surface.

### ID.AM-05 — Resources are prioritized based on classification, criticality, and business value.

> Prioritizing critical assets helps focus limited security resources for maximum impact.

## Protect

### PR.AA-01 — Identities and credentials are managed

> Default credentials are a common attack and should be vector—managed with intent.

### PR.AA-03 — Users/services/hardware are authenticated

> Only verified entities should interact with systems, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

### PR.DS-01 — Data-at-rest is protected

> Controls like encryption and content-type headers prevent data leaks.

### PR.DS-10 — Integrity checking mechanisms are used

> File exposures or tampering can be detected through integrity monitoring.

### PR.IR-01 — Communications and control networks are protected

> Secure networks prevents unauthorized access and maintains system integrity.

### ID.RA-01 — Vulnerability scans are performed

> Routine scanning detects outdated components and known issues.


---

## Detect

### DE.CM-01 — The network is monitored to detect potential cybersecurity events

> Monitoring network traffic helps detect intrusions, anomalies, and other cybersecurity events early

### DE.CM-07 — Monitoring for unauthorized changes to systems is performed

> File or configuration drift detection is a key indicator of compromise.

---

## Respond

### RS.MA-01 — Response plan is executed

> Testing your IR plan ensures you're ready when incidents occur.

### RS.CO-02 — Public relations are managed

> Clear external communication reduces panic and damage during incidents.

### RS.CO-03 — Incident response information is shared with stakeholders

> Communicating incident details with stakeholders ensures coordinated actions.

### RS.MI-01 — Incidents are mitigated

> Effective mitigation limits the impact of breaches.

### RS.IM-02 — Threats are eliminated

> Removing threats restores normal operations and prevents recurrence.

---

## Recover

### RC.RP-01 — Recovery plan is executed

> Restoration procedures must be tested and reliable.

### RC.RP-02 — Recovery policies and procedures established and maintained

> Systems are restored systems quickly and consistently after an incident following a clearly defined process.

### RC.RP-05 — Integrity of restored assets should be verified after recovery.

> Operations can resume safely when restored assets are verfied as uncompromised, 

### RC.CO-03 — Recovery status is communicated with stakeholders.

> Recovery effort is coordinated effectively when stakeholders are informed`.
